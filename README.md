# Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge - HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Feedback

Good job with the project. The ul in your index.html could be wrapped with nav tags. Your hero section could be wrapped in figure tags. Good job with your readme and good job with links to the deployed version. Your css is consolidated. The repo needs to have an unique name.

Good job with the project.
